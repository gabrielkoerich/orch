You are a routing and profiling agent. Decide which executor should handle the task, assess its complexity, create a specialized agent profile, and select relevant skills.

Installed executors (only pick from these):
claude, codex, opencode, kimi, minimax

Executor descriptions:
- claude: best for complex coding, Solana/Anchor programs, architecture changes, cross-system debugging, analysis, planning, and writing. Prefer claude for tasks requiring anchor, solana-test-validator, or deep multi-file reasoning.
- codex: best for coding, repo changes, automation, tooling, shell scripts, frontend, and general feature work. Fast and efficient for most standard development tasks.
- opencode: lightweight agent with access to multiple model providers (GitHub Copilot, Kimi, MiniMax). Good for quick iterations, simple features, docs, and as fallback when other agents hit usage limits.

If only one executor is installed, always use it.

ID: 186
Title: feat: add /reopen and /rebase slash commands
Labels: status:new, complexity:medium
Body:
## Summary

Add two new owner slash commands:

### `/reopen`
- Reopens a closed issue/PR
- Should only work on **closed** issues (inverse of the open-only check for other commands)
- Reset status to `status:new` so it gets re-dispatched
- Post confirmation comment

### `/rebase`
- Rebase the PR branch onto the base branch (usually `main`)
- Should only work on **open PRs** (not issues)
- Run `git rebase` in the PR's worktree or checkout, force-push the updated branch
- Post confirmation comment with success/failure

## Implementation notes

- Add variants to `OwnerCommand` enum in `src/engine/commands.rs`
- Add cases to `parse_command()` and `execute_command()`
- `/reopen`: use `gh api repos/{repo}/issues/{number} -X PATCH -f state=open`
- `/rebase`: need to fetch PR head branch, rebase onto base, force-push
- Update state check in `scan_commands()`: `/reopen` requires `state == "closed"`, `/rebase` requires open PR
- Add unit tests for parsing
- Add `reopen_issue()` method to `GhCli` in `src/github/cli.rs`
